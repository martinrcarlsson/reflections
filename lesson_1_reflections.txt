What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    You reflect more on the code written before commit when it is done manually

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Large projects with many files demands other type of version control than small projects

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff I know about, git log I haven't used yet, will try it out

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	pro's: more control over the logical of commits
	con's: you have to stay disciplined

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because in large projects it would be tedious to do it one-by-one

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	To find certain commits and for example how many lines that were changed in that commit
